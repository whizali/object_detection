# object_detection
a Python-based implementation of a real-time object detection application using the webcam. The project utilizes OpenCV for video capture and processing and cvlib for object detection using pre-trained deep learning model known as YOLO. The application detects common objects in real-time from the COCO dataset and displays bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.
